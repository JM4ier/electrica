# Electrica

This page contains all resources to my video game Electrica.
The premise of the game is that you can build any logic circuit.
It is entirely possible to create a CPU, but there are no guides to that.
There also should be an educational aspect in the game, but the task system of the game is not documented well, 
which is the reason why it is rather hard for a person with no knowledge in electric circuits to build one.

The game can be played on Windows, Linux, MacOS, or directly in the browser. You can find the download links below or [try out the game online](online).
However, before playing, I recommend to read through the quick guide to the game, as there is no such guide in the game.
