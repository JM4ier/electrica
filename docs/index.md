# The Video game

This is a place where you can play my video game, electrica.
There is a version that you can play entirely online.
However, some features don't work properly online and in the WebGL version, such as saving progress.

I highly recommend downloading it for Windows or Linux.

There is a guide to the game in [English](guide) as well as in [German](anleitung).
